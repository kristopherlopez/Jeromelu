# Jaromelu Task Queue

Persistent queue for the long-lived implementer session. The implementer reads top-down, completes one task at a time, dispatches `adversarial-reviewer` against the diff + task + plan, and only checks off after the review passes.

## Format

Each task is a level-3 heading with three labelled blocks:

- **What** — exactly what to do. References a section of `PLAN.md`.
- **How to verify** — concrete checks. Commands, files, expected output. Bar: "if satisfied exactly as written, the result is trustworthy."
- **Proof notes** — an optional in-flight scratchpad only. The **authoritative** proof record is the task's entry in the active run report under [`docs/build/runs/`](./runs/), written **at checkoff (after the review passes)**.

**Proof timing (important for reviewers):** under the run-report ritual, proof is recorded into the run report *at checkoff*, which is downstream of the review. So an **empty Proof-notes block at review time is expected and is NOT a blocker** — the reviewer verifies the diff against the spec and runs the **How to verify** checks itself; proof recording is a post-pass step.

Mark as `[x]` only after `adversarial-reviewer` passes. Once it passes, record what the task delivered in the active run report under [`docs/build/runs/`](./runs/) and **remove it from this file** — TASKS.md holds only the live queue, not a completed-task graveyard (see the run-report ritual in [META.md](./META.md)).

### Tags

Prefix the title with optional tags in square brackets:

- `[P0]`, `[P1]`, `[P2]`, `[P3]` — severity (from `issue-triager`)
- `[BLOCKED: reason]` — implementer hit a wall; needs human input

## Open tasks

_(queue empty — no open tasks)_


## Completed work

Completed tasks are not kept here. When a task passes review and is checked off, what it delivered is recorded in the active run report under [`docs/build/runs/`](./runs/) and the task is removed from this file. This queue holds only open/in-flight work.
